      <li> 
         <h4>Chart constraints</h4> are defined for the whole chart and cannot be changed by a user.<br />
         By default the chart is exactly wide to display all objects (Main, Milestone, Flow, Run, Flags, Points and Resources) in all rows and also the GanttBase and GanttFinish.
         The task Constraints objects affect the chart width only if set GanttShowConstraints='2'.
         <br />
         The chart is resized whenever the most left or the most right object moves inside or some object moves otuside the chart.<br />
         <ul>
            <li>
               The <h3>MaxWidth</h3> and <h3>MinWidth</h3> specify maximal and minimal width of the column, in pixels.<br />
               The maximal MaxWidth is limited by various browser limits, for Opera it is 23,000, for IE it is 178,957.
            </li>
            <li>
               The <h3>GanttChartMinStart</h3> and <h3>GanttChartMaxEnd</h3> define bounds for the whole chart, 
               the chart will never show outside dates (except applying column <b>MinWidth</b> attribute).<br />
               No Gantt object can be moved or created outside these bounds.
            </li>
            <li>
               The <h3>GanttChartMaxStart</h3> and <h3>GanttChartMinEnd</h3> define minimal date range for the whole chart,
               the chart will always show the dates inside the range (except applying column <b>MaxWidth</b> attribute).<br />
               These bounds has no effect for the Gantt objects.<br />
               If MaxStart == MinStart and MinEnd == MaxEnd the chart size is fixed and it always shows the same dates (except applying MaxWidth/MinWidth).
            </li>
            <li>
               The <b>GanttChartRound</b> rounds the first and last date shown in the chart to given units (like "y" for year, "d" for days).<br />
               The <b>GanttLeft</b> and <b>GanttRight</b> adds given count of empty GanttUnits on the chart sides.<br />
            </li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
         <h4>Project constraints</h4> are defined for the whole chart and can be optionally changed by a user.<br />
         The project constraints can be hidden, but still used when set <b>GanttShowBounds</b>='0'.<br />
         <ul>
            <li>
               <h3>GanttBase</h3> defines the project baseline.<br /> 
               On the baseline should start all tasks without incoming dependencies, if set <b>GanttStrict</b>='1' and the dependencies are corrected, auto or manually.<br />
               If the baseline is not set or it is deleted, the (thin) baseline is displayed on start date of the most left task in the chart, but does not affect anything.<br />
               No gantt object can be moved or create before baseline if set <b>GanttBaseProof</b>='1'.<br />
               The baseline can be changed by mouse dragging if set <b>GanttBaseCanEdit</b>='1'.<br />
               The baseline can be read and changed also by API by methods <b>GetGanttBase</b> and <b>SetGanttBase</b>, usually for let users to edit it in some cell.<br />
               The baseline is uploaded to server in &lt;Gantt> XML tag when set Upload_Type='Gantt'.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>GanttFinish</h3> defines the project finish date.<br /> 
               The project finish is mostly used to calculate critical path, by calculating <b>GanttSlack</b> value for every task. 
                  The critical tasks have zero (or small) value of the slack.<br />
               If the project finish is not set or it is deleted, the project finish is set to end date of the most right task in the chart,
                  it is displayed as thin line and is still used for critical path calculation.<br />
               No gantt object can be moved or create after project finish if set <b>GanttFinishProof</b>='1'.<br />
               The project finish can be changed by mouse dragging if set <b>GanttFinishCanEdit</b>='1'.<br />
               The project finish can be read and changed also by API by methods <b>GetGanttFinish</b> and <b>SetGanttFinish</b>, usually for let users to edit it in some cell.<br />
               The project finish is uploaded to server in &lt;Gantt> XML tag when set Upload_Type='Gantt'.<br />
            </li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
         <h4>Task constraints</h4> are defined individually for every task.<br />
         The task constraints are shown in chart as icons, or can be hidden if set <b>GanttShowConstraints</b>='0'.<br />
         The constraints can affect moving tasks while correcting dependencies, creating, moving or resizing task by a user 
            and creating, moving or resizing other Gantt object, the functions are specified by <b>GanttUseConstraints</b>.<br />
         The constraints can be created, moved and deleted by a user if <b>GanttEdit</b> contains "Constraints" keyword.<br />
         <ul>
            <li>
               <h3>GanttMinStart</h3> is <b>early start</b> constraint, the task cannot start before this date.<br />
               With GanttMaxStart on the same date it creates <b>mandatory start</b> constraint, the task must start on this date.
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>GanttMaxStart</h3> is <b>late start</b> constraint, the task cannot start after this date.<br />
               It is used only for main bar, not for other Gantt objects like flow or milestone.
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>GanttMinEnd</h3> is <b>early end</b> constraint, the task cannot finish before this date.<br />
               It is used only for main bar, not for other Gantt objects like flow or milestone.
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>GanttMaxEnd</h3> is <b>late start</b> constraint, the task cannot finish after this date.<br />
               With GanttMinEnd on the same date it creates <b>mandatory end</b> constraint, the task must finish on this date.
