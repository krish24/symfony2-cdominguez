   <ul>
      <li>
         The correct dependencies are shown blue, the incorrect dependencies in red.
      </li>
      <li>
         Attribute <h3>GanttIncorrectDependencies</h3> controls which dependencies will be marked as incorrect.<br />
         For 1 will be marked as incorrect only dependencies that start (+lag) before they end.<br />
         For 2 will be marked as incorrect all dependencies that don't start (+lag) and end on the same date.<br />
         For individual dependency it can be changed by <b>float</b> value in the dependency definition (after the !).<br />
     </li>
     <li>
      The dependencies are corrected by moving the related tasks. The tasks are never resized in this action. 
      The tasks are never moved to violate their constraints.<br />
      Only tasks defined in <b>GanttObject</b> are moved when correcting dependencies. 
      If there are more objects defined here, only the first object defined in the Gantt cell is moved - it is the one the dependency is attached to.
     </li>
     <li>
      The dependencies can be corrected <b>manually</b> by clicking to the first button (Correct) on toolbar. <br />
      Or by choosing item "Correct all dependencies" or "Correct related dependencies" in the Gantt popup menu.<br />
      Or by calling the action <b>CorrectAllDependencies</b> or <b>CorrectDependencies</b>.
     </li>
     <li>
      The dependencies can be corrected <b>automatically</b> (or by user confirmation) after any change in the chart, according to <h3>GanttCorrectDependencies</h3> attribute value.<br />
      The one changed tasks can be also automatically corrected or it can be fixed and all other tasks are moved to correct the dependencies, it is controlled by <b>GanttCorrectDependenciesFixed</b> attribute.
     </li>
     <li>
      There are two methods of correcting the dependencies, chosen by <h3>GanttStrict</h3> attribute.<br />
      By default (for 1) are all tasks moved as close to baseline as possible.<br />
      For 0 are the tasks moved as little as possible to only correct the dependencies. They are likely moved to the right. <br />
     </li>
     <li>
      <h4>Circular dependencies</h4> checking is controlled by <h3>GanttCheckDependencies</h3>, it is possible to restrict, permit or ask the creating.<br />
      The tasks containing circular dependencies are usually impossible to correct.<br />
     </li>
     <li>
      By attribute <h3>GanttFixComplete</h3> is possible to fix all already started tasks (with Complete>0) and move only not yet started tasks (Complete=0).<br />
      In this case dependency between two already started tasks is always marked correct.
     </li>
   </ul>
